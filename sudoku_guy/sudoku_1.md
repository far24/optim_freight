This year, I have decided to learn the mind game "Sudoku" in-depth.  I know the basics of sudoku. This series of blogpost highlights different tricks and tips that are unknown to me.
My primary learning source is from a the youtube channel of [**Sudoku Guy**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd8JaOdfEWcJOtwG6YayW0w).
