## About Me
I am a graduate Reseach Assistant in the CEE department at University of South Carolina. My research lab there is "SCTransportation Group".
The focus of our work relates broadly to freight transportation. Currently, I am working on a problem (details will be provided) related to vehicle routing problem with cross-dock (VRPCD).

## Aim of this BLOG
The aim of this blog is to learn Julia/Jump optimization programmming through problem solving.  Initially this blog will contain the mathematical programming I have been trying to solve for my reseach.
